The two examples show the use of GaleProt for folding proteins, and
designing sequences to increase Pnat (or deltaG).

The ../data directory contains all files needed to run the examples:
-contact maps for 10,000 compact 64-mers
-Miyazawa and Jernigan 1996 interaction potential
-indices of surface residues of the compact 64-mers, needed for binding
calculations
-set of random sequences

The folding.cpp example loads 64-mer sequences from a big file, 
and calculates their Pnat and index of native structures.
It then loads a list of pairs of sequences to calculate binding energy in,
and calculates binding.

The protein-design.cpp example uses a Monte Carlo approach 
to start with 100,000 random 64-mers, and mutates them to increase 
Pnat over 10 iterations. This design procedure was used by 
Berezovsky et al for 27-mers in a 2007 PLoS CB paper,
